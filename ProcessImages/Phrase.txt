I hear you.
I'll bite.
I'll have to beg off.  
I'm all ears.
I'm easy.
I'm with you.
In this day and age.
I read you loud and clear.
I spoke out of turn.
It's not half bad.
It's on me.
It's time to split.
It's your funeral.

Not for my money.
Not in a thousand years!
Not in my book.
Now you're cooking!
Now you're talking!
Okay by me.
...or words to that effect.
Over my dead body!
Pardon me for living!
Off the top of my head?
See if I care!
What else is new?
Speak of the devil.
Take my word for it.
Take it from me.
That does it!
That's more like it.
That's the last straw!
That's the ticket!
Way to go!

What part of this don't you understand?
Don't even go there.
Is this some kind of sick joke?
Oh haha, very funny.
Did I just say that out loud?
It's just a scratch.
How is it?
